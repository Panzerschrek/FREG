Eyecube is a MinecraftÂ©-inspired game for Linux terminals.

It uses neither GUI nor CLI, it is based on text, and without ASCII- and ANSI-art.
It is written in C with ncurses and pthread libraries.

It is not even an alpha version for now, and there is lot of work to do.
This program is an interface experiment, it will try to be a prototype, proof of concept.

Advices are welcome.

Compile notes:
I use gcc with -lncurses and -pthread keys.
