FREG is a free-roaming elementary game.
Inspired by Minecraft and Angband.

Development stage: implementing basics.

Language: C++
Non-standard libraries: ncurses, pthreads

Compile:
g++ -lncurses -pthread main.cpp world.cpp blocks.cpp screen.cpp -o FREG.bin

Development is run on GNU/Linux, but on MS Windows should work too with PDCurses ( http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/ ) and Pthreads-w32 ( http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/ ).

Now only singleplayer is developed, multiplayer is planned.

Screenshots of early versions are available here:
