Eyecube is a MinecraftÂ©-inspired game for Linux terminals.

It uses text graphics.
It is written in C with ncurses and pthread libraries.

It is not even an alpha version for now, and there is lot of work to do.
This program is an interface experiment.

Advices are welcome.

i386 version might be older than one for amd64.

directory 'map' should exist in directory with executable
