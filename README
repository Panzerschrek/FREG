Eyecube is a MinecraftÂ©-inspired game for Linux terminals.

It uses text graphics.
It is written in C with ncurses and pthread libraries.

It is not even an alpha version for now, and there is lot of work to do.
This program is an interface experiment.

Advices are welcome.

i386 version might be older than amd64 one.

Run notes:
directory 'map' should exist in directory with executable

Compile notes:
(libncurses5-dev should be installed)
gcc -lncurses -pthread

Debug notes:
./Eyecube-*.bin 2>log
